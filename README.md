# Airline Customer Stisfaction
## Overview
This Python-based machine learning project aims to predict airline customer satisfaction using a Machine Learning Model.It is trained on a dataset containing customer feedback and flight-related attributes to classify whether a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight experience.

## Key Insights
In Preprocessing Handle Missing Values by filling or removing rows with missing data, Converted non-numeric columns (such as gender, flight class) into numerical format using Label encoding and Standardize numerical columns where required to improve model performance. We use a Decision Tree Classifier due to its interpretability and visual explainability, which is well-suited for understanding customer behavior patterns.
